I was conf. Karen Harrington.My doctor ready. It's me. Hi, Karen. How? How are you today?I'm doing OK, I heard last. This week you're having some stomach issues. Yeah, I was. It was. Pleasant at all?What did you notice? It started out with cramping. And I had some, uh. Some Constipation, OK. And it the cramping was really intense and it. Just throughout the night.13/9. Oh gosh, And I didn't have any bleeding, which is. That's why I didn't go to the.Uh, any fever? Is there anything?No, I did not have fevers. OK, I have.Just a little bit. Bit of chills but that went away fast and OK. I don't know if, uh, the. The dermatologist had prescribed me doxycycline. Uh-huh. No, I'm on DOTS recycling. And you're wondering if that might have helped prevent something from getting worse. Exactly. Gotcha. That's an interesting thought. I. It's certainly possible the. The bacteria that normally cause diverticulitis, Umm. Are usually not super responsive to doxycycline. The Yeah, you know I'm. For some people that you know like, it may be that you just. If this was diverticulitis, it's possible that either the doxycycline or just urine. One immune system took care of it.Umm. Do you? Was there anything that happened in the day? Couple days before or anything you know unusual foods or. Exposure to anything that.Else that could have caused the issue. Well, I don't know, I have been eating some. Pistachios, OK. I don't know if that could cause it.The. You know when they have looked at sort of data on this like for diverticulitis? This umm, you know, the avoiding the nuts, the seeds kind of thing that. It turns out the evidence actually isn't that great. I think there's a. You know, we can sort of imagine how having a. Small nut or seed getting caught in one of those divertic. Particular pouches could cause an issue. Umm. But it's not totally clear that this is actually the case.What's happening? Umm, well regardless, I'm so glad you're feeling better. Umm, if it were to. Happen again, you know. Please, even without the bleeding, it's OK to come. Umm, you know, the clinic or to the ER? Yeah, I am not. Been having regular bowel movements either and. About two and a half three weeks ago. At 2:00 in the morning, I had a very. Painful episode in. And it lasted for over an hour. Umm, was. Were you in the midst of a bowel movement? When it happened or no, I was asleep. Oh. Huh. OK, I was asleep. I. Happened at 2:00 in the morning and it was just really sharp and. Long lasting. It didn't. It didn't let up it. Was just constant for over an hour. OK, umm. Yeah, the uh. Do you think so? That certainly can't happen when people are feeling constipated. Umm, do you feel like you've been kind of bouncing back and forth between? And Constipation and.Diarrhea or like what have your bowel movements? I'm like I guess.Umm, I have. Constipation and then.I'll. You know when I drink a lot of water, so it's not an issue of my hydration. Mm-hmm.And then I'll ask. A small amount of small poops or a large amount of small. OK, OK.Do you feel? Gotcha.Are you and you're still doing the? Umm, uh, the mirror. Wax type medication.Yeah, OK.Do you think that? That's been helpful to you.Yeah, it has been helpful to me when I. Layoff of it it.You know. I I have more problems with.Bye. Constipation, OK.Umm. And are you using any fiber like psyllium husks or? Anything like that? Yeah, I've been alternating the. The Miralax with the psyllium has to. But cause not to take it together. Uh, the uh, yeah. It says. To take both of those together like on the.Miralax. Wax bottle or the. That's what I read online anyway, They kind of do the same. Thing, right, yeah. So it's like sort of taken more of. It is OK to take take both. But if you're starting to have.Most like that are too like they, won't they? Don't interact with each other. They won't hurt each other necessarily, but they sort of. Work in kind of the same way by, you know, making your story. People have more fluid, basically. I can take those in the same day, yes. Yeah. OK. So if you'd like to give that a try. I think that's reasonable. Umm, there's also another. When we think about laxatives, there are other types of laxatives. That can be helpful.Um, really? Focus on trying to improve the quality of your stool basically so. Umm, and, you know, dialing in. To kind of the right amount for you is a good idea. But the other kind of laxative works by. You know, having your, uh, your bowels start kind. Squeezing and pushing forward like hey, you guys are going too slow. Move along.Umm. Have you ever used a medicine like that? Like something called Senna is like the? Common version of that.What is it called Senna? No, OK.If you like, I can send some to you. See how you feel with it.OK, Yeah. And if any of this like causes you to feel like, oh, I'm feeling more gassy or. Are actually I guess that. Be the one thing with the fiber and the Miralax like that could make you feel a little bit gassy. OK, so you don't think that that my. CS umm frequent amount. Of stools that I have that are small as an underlying. Issue with something else?I don't think it's, you know, I don't think it's. And underlying.You know, I don't think it. Describe something dangerous per SE. Umm, but it does make me. About, you know.Are we Are you effectively evacuating your? Like are you?Is. Bowel health as good as it could be and wondering whether. Like focusing on trying to treat Constipation and making sure things are moving along. Smoothly may make you feel better generally. OK. We can give that a try. Let me send you, you know, why don't you stick with the with the regimen. Now of like the Miralax or the fiber and let me just send you the Senna and see. If that helps you.OK, do I have to? Like wait a couple of hours after taking one. Does the miralax before I take the?Otherwise. CSM uh fiber oh the fi yeah I. That's a great question. I don't know the answer to that. Umm, I don't, I don't think so. I think it's OK to use them both. Uh, let me let me take a look here. OK. Yeah. So, yeah. So it is actually totally. Finally, use them both and it's OK to keep them together the. Umm, uh, one thing that you know. Do you increase that business? Uh. You know, especially the you may get more kind of bloating. And you know, if you're not able to pass gas that can feel like. And kind of sharp things sometimes.Uh. So rather than trying to like re. Increase that right now. Can I send you this? On medication instead and see if that helps the Constipation a little bit. More OK, OK. Now, is that OK to take a? What are my other medications? It is that I'm on it, definitely. What is it? Is it a powder? Former umm, no, it's actually a pill. And you can, you know. Take either one or two pills, usually at bedtime and the next day. It'll it tends to help you evacuate. A little bit more easily.OK. But I don't take that in conjunction with the. Uh, Miralax or the fiber? No, no, keep doing exactly what you're doing now, basically. So and then so the reason to do that is just to see like. Hey, if and it's OK to take all of this on the same day, OK? But by sticking to doing what you're doing right now and we'll just. Add this one medicine.And see if making one change. Time, yeah.And see if that. Helps you move things along a little bit better.OK, OK. Umm, well, why don't I send that to you and then? Can you just umm, do you want to set up another call to do a check in? A few weeks. OK, well, why don't we do that? And I was also wondering if you could. Umm, I I'm out of my Flonase. Expired, OK. My vitamin D3 I don't have. Of the information on. Map to reorder it. OK, let me I've umm. Find off in the Flonase and I will get the vitamin D3 for you too. Thank you. You're very welcome. Anything else I can try to do for you?I think that's it. I'm just concerned about the level of pain that I. I've been having and it just doesn't seem like it's normal. Are regular, so. Question chat with you. I'm really I'm glad you did. I.The. Let me sing.I'm trying to recall you've had. Your last colonoscopy was back in 2020.Like. I had what? I'm sorry, what was that? I was just looking at your uh. Last colonoscopy back in 2020. Oh yeah, yeah. Umm. And it really showed kind of what we already know. Diverticulosis and small hemorrhoids. So I'll say that that the symptom. Systems that you're talking about.Don't make me worried about something like. Cancer suddenly showing up.OK, OK. If that's something. That's been on your mind? Umm.It. Bowel movements can really change quite a lot, like from person to person and. Even over time for the same person.And. Something that seems as simple as Constipation can actually. They cause significant issues. I think you're doing the right thing by trying to like. Focus on getting a good bowel regimen and looking at your diet. And everything else.Because you had diverticulitis before? For it, I think you know.It's certainly possible that this. Last week you did have a, you know, a mild case that your body was able. Fight off on its own.It's hard to know. Certain, but if it were to happen again. You know, happy to have you come in and we can do our best to assess you. OK.Is there something in? Particularly that that you're worried about might be going on inside. Well, I was just worried about, you know, since I. I'm a cancer survivor of breast cancer. I was. You know, concerned that it could be a colon issue. Absolutely. I think that's a really thoughtful and good point. Like the. Umm, you know the fact that. Five years ago you had a fully, you know as. There was no even precancerous polyps or anything. And things like colon cancer usually take a long. Time to develop and which is why you know the screening happens every. Ten years or so.Umm. And the fact that you didn't have anything even precancerous at that time. It's really reassuring.Different cancers act. Very differently, colon cancer tends to be one of the slowest to go. Grow. But the reason that it hurts so many people is that. Umm, you know, they just don't get screenings. Right. Or, umm, so you think you've already done. Right things and and certainly if you know this continues. Probably have you just go back and see if the GI clinic again?Uh. And see if they have any advice or guidance for us. OK. If you mean the diverticulitis? Exactly. OK. So should I stop eating pistachios altogether? Umm. I think it's OK to keep eating pistachios.OK. Good 'cause I really enjoy them. If you, I mean if you find like, hey, every time I have pistachios or a bunch of pistachi. Shows I get sick, OK that's one thing. But. One off.That's fine, just just keep enjoying. The, uh, the fine pistachios. Because I know I'm getting older and things in your body. How do you change Should I be eating dates? Oh, uh, you know. It certainly wouldn't. Yeah, I think it's fine to eat dates. I don't think you have to eat dates. I haven't before.Do you enjoy it? What's what made you think of dates in particular? Saw them in the grocery store one day and I thought I wonder if I should add. Ask Doctor Reddy that, because I remember. I don't know. My grandparents eating it sort of thing. And they were older.So I don't know. In common that you're supposed to do when you get up in age. You definitely don't have to. If you enjoy dates, you should eat dates that's. The big thing if you're looking for sort of natural ways to like get the ballast. Moving.Prunes actually do have do work for that. And it's worth considering. Either a bit of prune juice or actual prunes. OK, Yeah.But you don't have to. Don't worry about it. Don't. Don't feel obligated to go out and get prunes. Alright, well. I'm so glad you're feeling better and and if you start feeling worse again, please. Let us know or just come right in, OK?OK. All right. Thanks, Karen.So should I set up an appointment with you now or? Or should I wait and talk to Megan? I'll ask our scheduler, Cody to reach out to you. And set up a phone call for in a few weeks. OK, OK.Excellent. All right. Any other? Questions for me.No, I think that that's it. OK, well, great. I will. Hope you have a wonderful day and week. Take care. Thank you very much and I hope you do too. Thanks.", "draftNote": "\n          ", "patientInstructions": "", "to_dos": [], "heyOmarQueries": []}}
