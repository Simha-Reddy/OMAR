She did not have any associated fever or bleeding but noted mild chills that resolved quickly. She has been eating pistachios recently and wondered if they could be contributing to her symptoms. The patient also mentioned a prior episode of sharp, prolonged abdominal pain occurring approximately 2-3 weeks ago at 2:00 AM, which lasted over an hour and was not associated with a bowel movement.  \n\nShe describes ongoing issues with constipation, alternating with small, frequent bowel movements. She has been using Miralax and psyllium husk intermittently, which she finds helpful, although she avoids taking them together. She inquired about the safety of combining these treatments and was reassured that they can be used together.  \n\nThe patient expressed concern about whether her symptoms could indicate a more serious underlying condition, particularly given her history of breast cancer. She was reassured that her last colonoscopy in 2020 showed diverticulosis and small hemorrhoids, with no evidence of precancerous polyps or malignancy.  \n\nShe also asked about dietary considerations, including pistachios and dates, and was advised that these foods are generally safe unless she notices a specific pattern of symptoms after consuming them.  \n\nHABITS  \nNot discussed.\n\nPAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY  \n- Diverticulosis  \n- Breast cancer (in remission)  \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY  \nNot discussed.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY  \nNot discussed.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM  \n| Date       | Type   | Value   | Unit        |  \n|------------|--------|---------|-------------|  \n| 2025-09-29 | BP     | 116/70  | mmHg        |  \n| 2025-09-29 | HR     | 63      | bpm         |  \n| 2025-09-29 | Pulse  | 63      | bpm         |  \n| 2025-09-29 | RR     | 18      | breaths/min |  \n| 2025-09-29 | SpO2   | 99      | %           |  \n| 2025-09-29 | Temp   | 97.7    | F           |  \n| 2025-09-29 | Weight | 147.7   | lbs         |  \n| 2025-09-29 | BMI    | 23.53   |             |  \n| 2024-03-14 | Height | 66.5    | in          |  \n\nNo additional physical exam findings were discussed.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS  \nThe patient’s last colonoscopy in 2020 showed diverticulosis and small hemorrhoids, with no evidence of precancerous polyps or malignancy.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN  \n1. Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal cramping, constipation, and small bowel movements): Likely related to diverticulosis and constipation.  \n   - Continue current regimen of Miralax and psyllium husk.  \n   - Add Senna (1-2 pills at bedtime) to improve bowel movements.  \n   - Monitor for any worsening symptoms or new concerning features (e.g., bleeding, fever).  \n   - Reassured patient that symptoms are not suggestive of malignancy given her normal colonoscopy in 2020.  \n\n2. Medication refills:  \n   - Flonase: Refill sent.  \n   - Vitamin D3: Refill sent.  \n\nRETURN TO CLINIC  \nA follow-up phone call will be scheduled in a few weeks to reassess symptoms and response to treatment.  \n\n> This clinical documentation was assisted using an AI scribe. The patient was informed of the presence of a listening and transcribing tool during the visit and given the option to opt out and agreed to proceed.
